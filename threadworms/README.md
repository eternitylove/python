threadworms
===========

A multithreaded programming demonstration in Python &amp; Pygame using a "Nibbles" clone.

[Demo is on the Invent with Python Blog](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2013/04/22/multithreaded-python-tutorial-with-threadworms/)

This Python & Pygame script shows a simple window where "worms" of various
lengths and speed run around. The program demonstrates multithreaded programming
and using locks to make the code threadsafe (worms will never go through each
other.)

This code works with either Python 3 or Python 2. You need Pygame installed to
run it.

Uncomment the setGridSquares() function call to draw static squares on the map,
instead of having a completely open field. You can also try adjusting the
constants at the top of the file.
